# Virtual Assistant Luna

Luna is a simple virtual assistant written in Python.  
It can perform basic tasks such as:
- Open applications or websites
- Perform small utility tasks
- Playing music

## Why this project?
I created Luna to practice Python and demonstrate my programming skills.  
This is not a finished product, but a showcase of what I have learned so far.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python luna.py`

## Future Plans
- Integration with APIs
- Smarter response system
